*Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. In this project, we used Chrome which requires chromedriver. You need to download the chromedriver and install it at first from here: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads 

Make sure chromedriver is in your PATH, e.g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin

And when you run this code, make sure you change the path to your PATH
from selenium import webdriver  
browser = webdriver.Chrome('/Users/yutingzhang/Desktop/chromedriver')

You can find detailed instructions here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html
There is also detailed instruction for windows users.
